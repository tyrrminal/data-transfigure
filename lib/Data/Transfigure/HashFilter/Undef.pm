# ABSTRACT: filters out undefined hash values whose keys match a pattern

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::HashFilter::Undef - filters out undefined hash values whose 
keys match a pattern

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::HashFilter::Undef> removes the key and corresponding value
from the hash in cases where the value is undefined and the key matches a given
regular expression. Matching keys can also be rewritten at the same time.

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 key_pattern (optional param)

A compiled regular expression (C<qr/.../>) identifying keys that this 
transfigurator can apply to. If a capture group is included in the regex, the
key is rewritten to its content (additional capture groups are ignored).

Default: C<qr/(.*)\?/>
