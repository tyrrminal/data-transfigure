# ABSTRACT: converts hash keys to lowerCamelCase

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::HashKeys::CamelCase - converts hash keys to 
lowerCamelCase

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::HashKeys::CamelCase> is intended for cases where the
backend policies require C<snake_case> but the frontend (and API) policies 
dictate C<camelCase>. As a post-process transfigurator, adding it rewrites all of 
the structure's hash keys to the proper format in that scenario.
