# ABSTRACT: the root role which all Data::Transfigure transfigurators must implement

=encoding UTF-8
 
=head1 NAME
 
Data::Transfigure::Node - the root role which all Data::Transfigure transfigurators 
must implement

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Node> must be implemented by all transfigurators used by 
L<Data::Transfigure>

=cut

use Object::Pad;

role Data::Transfigure::Node {

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 handler (required param)

The handler param accepts a CODEREF/anonymous subroutine which itself receives 
a single parameter, the data element to transfigure, and is expected to return the
transfigured value.

=cut

  field $handler : param;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 applies_to( %params )

C<applies_to> is required to be supplied by classes implementing this role.

This method recieves a param hash with keys C<value> and C<position> and returns
a constant from C<Data::Transfigure::Constants> reflecting what degree
of match, if any, the transfigurator has to that node. Higher values are better 
matches.

=cut

  method applies_to;

=head2 transfigure( @args )

Executes the handler on the data element. Typically this shouldn't be called
manually or need to be overridden by subclasses.

=cut

  method transfigure (@args) {
    return $handler->(@args);
  }
}
