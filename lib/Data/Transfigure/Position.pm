# ABSTRACT: a compound transfigurator that specifies one or more locations within the data structure to apply to

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::Position - a compound transfigurator that specifies one or more 
locations within the data structure to apply to

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Data::Transfigure::Position->new(
      position => '/*/author',
      transfigurator => Data::Transfigure::Type->new(
        type => 'Result::Person',
        handler => sub ($data) {
          sprintf("%s, %s", $data->lastname, $data->firstname)
        }
      )
    ); # applies to any 2nd-level hash key "author", but only if that value's
       # type is 'Result::Person', and then performs a custom stringification

    Data::Transfigure::Position->new(
      position => '/book/author',
      transfigurator => Data::Transfigure::Default->new(
        handler => sub ($data ) {
          {
            firstname => $data->names->{first} // '',
            lastname  => $data->names->{last} // '',
          }
        }
      )
    ); # applies only to the node at $data->{book}->{author}, and tries to 
       # hash-ify the value there, regardless of its type.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Position> is a compound transfigurator, meaning that it both is,
and has, a transfigurator. The transfigurator you give it at construction can be of 
any type, with its own handler and match criteria. The 
C<Data::Transfigure::Position>'s handler will become the one from the supplied
transfigurator, so C<handler> should not be specified when creating this 
transfigurator.

This construction is used so that transfigurators can be treated like building
blocks and in some cases inserted to apply to the entire tree, but in other
scenarios, used much more specifically.

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 position (required parameter)

Ex. C<"/book/author">, C<"/*/*/title">, C<"/values/0/id">

A position specifier for a location in the data structure. The forward slash
character is used to delineate levels, which are hashes or arrays. The asterisk
character can be used to represent "anything" at that level, whether hash key
or array index.

Cam be an arrayref of position specifiers to match any of them.

=head2 transfigurator (required parameter)

A C<Data::Transfigure> transfigurator conforming to the C<Data::Transfigure::Node> 
role. Weird things will happen if you provide a 
C<Data::Transfigure::Tree> -type transfigurator, so you probably shouldn't do
that.

        $params{transfigurator}->transfigure(@args);
      }
    );
  }

=head1 applies_to( %params )

C<$params{position}> must exist, as well as any params required by the supplied
transfigurator.

Passes C<%params> to the instance's transfigurator's C<applies_to> method - if that
results in C<$NO_MATCH>, then that value is returned by this method.

Then, the C<position(s)> is/are checked against C<$params{position}>. If 
any matches exactly, returns C<$MATCH_EXACT_POSITION>. Otherwise, if any matches
with wildcard evaluation, returns C<$MATCH_WILDCARD_POSITION>.

If no positions match, returns C<$NO_MATCH>
