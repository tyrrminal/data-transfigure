=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::Tree::Merge - merges marked hashrefs into their parent hash

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Tree::Merge> allows you to mark a hashref key with a 
trailing C<%> to indicate that you want the HashRef pointed to by that key to be
merged into the HashRef containing it. Common keys are overwritten by the merged
data.
