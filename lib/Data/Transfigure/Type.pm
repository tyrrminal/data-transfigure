# ABSTRACT: a transfigurator that filters by reference type

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::Type - a transfigurator that filters by reference type

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Type> is a transfigurator that applies to one or more value
types. It detects both exact type matches and inherited type matches (including
role-implementing), giving priority to the former.

=cut

use Object::Pad;

class Data::Transfigure::Type : does(Data::Transfigure::Node) {
  use Data::Transfigure::Constants;

  use Scalar::Util qw(blessed);

=head1 FIELDS

=head2 type (required param)

The type to check against. To check for multiple types, provide an arrayref of
the type names.

=cut

  field $type : param;

  ADJUST {
    foreach my $t (grep {defined} $self->types()) {
      die("$t cannot be used with Data::Transfigure::Type - use Data::Transfigure::Schema")
        if ($t eq 'ARRAY' || $t eq 'HASH');
    }
  }

=head1 METHODS

=head2 types()

Returns a list of the types to be checked against

=cut

  method types() {
    return ref($type) eq 'ARRAY' ? $type->@* : $type;
  }

=head2 applies_to( %params )

Requires C<$params{value}> to exist

If C<$params{value}>'s type is exactly any of C<types()>, returns 
C<$MATCH_EXACT_TYPE>.

Otherwise, if the value's type is a subclass of any of C<types()>, returns
C<$MATCH_INHERITED_TYPE>.

Otherwise returns C<$NO_MATCH>.

=cut

  method applies_to (%params) {
    die('value is a required parameter for Data::Transfigure::Type->applies_to') unless (exists($params{value}));
    my $node = $params{value};

    my $rv = $NO_MATCH;
    if (my $r = ref($node)) {
      foreach ($self->types()) {
        return $MATCH_EXACT_TYPE    if ($r eq $_);
        $rv = $MATCH_INHERITED_TYPE if (blessed($node) && ($node->isa($_) || $node->DOES($_)));
      }
    }
    return $rv;
  }
