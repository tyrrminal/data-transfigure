# ABSTRACT: transfigures DBIx::Class::Rows into hashrefs

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::Type::DBIx - transfigures DBIx::Class::Rows into hashrefs

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Type::DBIx> is used to transfigure L<DBIx::Class::Row>
instances into JSON-able structures, using C<get_inflated_columns> to get make
a hashref from the object's keys (column names) and values.

This transfigurator does not traverse relationships, and instead just outputs the 
foreign key column's name and id value.
