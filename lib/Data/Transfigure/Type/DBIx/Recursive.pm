# ABSTRACT: transfigures DBIx::Class::Rows into hashrefs, traversing (some) relationships

=head1 NAME

Data::Transfigure::Type::DBIx - transfigures DBIx::Class::Rows into hashrefs, 
traversing (some) relationships

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Data::Transfigure::Type::DBIx> is used to transfigure L<DBIx::Class::Row>
instances into JSON-able structures, using C<get_inflated_columns> to get make
a hashref from the object's keys (column names) and values.

This transfigurator traverses to_one-type relationships, inserting the related
object into the resulting hashref with its relationship name as the key, instead
of the foreign key column name.
